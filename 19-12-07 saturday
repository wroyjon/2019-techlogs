*BIOS vs UEFI

* MBR - master boot record

*   ACPI, the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface. 
*
*  UEFI uses GPT partitioning scheme instead of MBR 
*
*GPT stands for GUID Partition Table. It’s a new standard that’s gradually replacing MBR. It’s associated with UEFI, which replaces *the clunky old BIOS with something more modern. GPT, in turn, replaces the clunky old MBR partitioning system with something more *modern. It’s called GUID Partition Table because every partition on your drive has a “globally unique identifier,” or GUID—a random *string so long that every GPT partition on earth likely has its own unique identifier.
*
*GPT doesn’t suffer from MBR’s limits. GPT-based drives can be much larger, with size limits dependent on the operating system and *its file systems. GPT also allows for a nearly unlimited number of partitions. Again, the limit here will be your operating system—*Windows allows up to 128 partitions on a GPT drive, and you don’t have to create an extended partition to make them work.
*
*On an MBR disk, the partitioning and boot data is stored in one place. If this data is overwritten or corrupted, you’re in trouble. *In contrast, GPT stores multiple copies of this data across the disk, so it’s much more robust and can recover if the data is *corrupted.
