*
*custom builds can give you some quality you won't get from mass production if your careful
*
*HP uses torx screws - 
*
*plug it in, video cable, save power cable for last 
*powers on, no video 
*powers off, ->  motherboard and power supply are communicating 
*fans spin, see if the fan on the video card spins, if not, start there 
*
*TAKE YOUR TIME - LET THE CAPS DRAIN OFF, PULL THE PLUG, HIT THE POWER ON BUTTON 
*TO DRAIN OFF THE RESIDUAL CHARGES 
*
*any PCI express video card should work for diagnostics 
*
*NEVER FORCE ANYTHING, make sure stuff is aligned 
*
*
*swap the video card, try it 
*
*swap the power supply , try it 
*
*when you don't know what's wrong you have to test everything, you can assume nothing 
*
*ANTEK 500 watt power supply is a great powersupply 
*
*so the power supply is ok, too,  
*
*so far we know, not the video card and not the power supply 
*
*also, the system spontaneously turned itself off 
*
*what's next? 
*
*unplug the hard drives 
*
*POST - power on self test
*
*
*pull the network card 
*
*working your way down, getting rid of anything that might cause it not to POST
*
*do it one thing at a time, it takes longer, but, clean results
*
*now find the BIOS , then look for a little jumper on the motherboard to "clear" the BIOS
*sometimes a brown out with cause the BIOS to get confused 
*
*find the battery,  check it with a battery tester
*
*let it sit at least an hour for the BIOS to drain 
*
*replace the battery 
*
*
*plug it back in and try it , it usually will take 30 seconds longer to boot after a BIOS reset
*
*
*pull the power plug, wait for the fans to stop, hit the power button again 
*
*pull some of the RAM,  - it booted 
*
*
*AMD that nobody could fix

*
*PCI slots  4x, 8x,  16x express pci (fastest - where you want the graphics card) 
*
*cable management 
*
*
*AC97 is an actual physical cable 
*HD - is the modern audio interface 
*
*motherboard  GiGAbythe GA FX990A UD3
*2GB ram DDR5 card
*
*
*cable management 
*use nylon zip ties 
*cables should run parallel to each other 
*
*MSI video card 
*
*PCI express slots x1, x2, x4, x8, x16 - has to do with databus width 
*
*graphics card should go in first PCI slot b/c it is the fastest, closest to CPU
*
*
*SATA ports are all not equal either, what drives are plugged into where makes a difference
*in performance 
*
*CPU AMD FX 
*
*thermal compound, CPUs are designed to run up to 100 degree celcius
*
*AMD CPUs.tend to run hotter, don't have the thresh hold for heat that intel does 
*
*use more power, (run hotter), cost more money to run

*work on recovering maggie's data
*hx
*oct -> redline on C drive , critical disk space shortage , start working on moving 
*data off C-drive to goflex 
*
*nov2018 -> clip to windows 10, recover win7 data to intermediate drive 
*       dump to goflex, USB stick, CDs (back around 2014) 
*
*nov2019 -> move data from goflex to new terabyte drive. retire goflex

#work on my internal conversation, emotional state, i am not a very good teacher 
#probably because i don't know the material that well myself 
#frustrated and angry with windows changing things as we work on it

*22:53 motherboard, AMD chips run hotter, shutdown at 70 degrees C
*
*
*ASUS motherboard user manuals 
* 
*FSB front side bus
*DDR SDRAM
*23:56  
*
*
*SDRAM synchronous dynmic random access memory 
*
*  so RAM has to argree with the motherboard/cpu speeds 
*
*CDI - course work 
*  review mag core memory  three wires, set, reset, and sense 
* then you had the CMOS ram , with the refresh circuitry 
* CMOS was just coming in,
